00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.359
the A long, long time ago, someone declared

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.079

that means or men that that means old women.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.560
Everyone equal. There would be one set of rules

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.689
for everyone. A level playing field. Life would

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.320
be fair. But even if that were true,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.950

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.229
my mother always denied the fact that I ever had

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.810

not have a father so handsome mind Now, let's

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:07.459
repeat the continent. Before school, my world was

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.060
very, very small. We had no TV and

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.720
no intimate. My whole world stretch from a cousin

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.230
but took house to my cousin themselves. Nothing else

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:23.410
existed from. So as I learned about the rest

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.639
of the world, one of the most mind blowing

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:35.019

We are very, very were great because we have

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.410
one another, but that doesn't make we are going

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:52.800

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.310
. And one day at the doctor's office, I

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:20.279

my view. Most definitely is unfortunately not given that

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.369
it's impossible to have sex with someone who never shut

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.070
up. Technically, that's not true. With acts

00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:16.739

You're a stick in the mud. Ever since the

00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:38.900
marriage fiasco, he has become the most boring person

00:36:39.369 --> 00:36:42.579
in the axe. Live a medal in terrorists,

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.469

all the chances in life. There is no such

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:52.030
Carne is everything. Karma is the reserve. I

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.170

files. And then he proceeded to massage my foot

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.829
with a guard like healing. And whenever we go

00:41:22.949 --> 00:41:25.150
