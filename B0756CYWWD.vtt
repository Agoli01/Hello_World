00:00:00.001 --> 00:02:57.699
by boats. So you get a flatter, overall

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.300
sound signature, the same noise canceling and longer battery

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.990
life these air good for 30 hours with active noise

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.310
canceling on, and that makes them just an insane

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.439
product from Sony. We still love these guys.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.069
Let's talk about the newcomer, though. Job run

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.710
, one of our favorite headphone brands and really a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.949
brand that has emerged in the last couple years to

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.939
lead the market in a couple places. This is

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.439
their first premium noise canceling headphones, and it's got

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.919
a couple things to set it apart. The first

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.360
thing is that it offers a whopping 36 hours of

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.789
battery life with noise canceling on. That's six hours

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.550
longer than Sony, 16 hours longer than those.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.449
And that means you'll be able to fly around the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.800
world with these babies without having to power them up

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.500
. They also sound quite good. We put them

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:44.199
somewhere between the Sony in the bows they don't offer

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.050
after X or L D A. C. But

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.439
they sure do sound flat and warm and make all

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.099
of your favorite tune sound great. One place that

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.870
we're not quite as big a fans of these headphones

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.650
as we are, the Sony in the boat is

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.569
the noise canceling. They don't white perform as well

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.819
as these two other premium headphones, and that's okay

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.620
because they cost$50 less just$300 that makes them

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.370
one of the best values you'll find in premium noise

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.270
canceling headphones, a place where you don't often talk

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.180
about value. So I spend a lot of time

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.899
with a lot of headphones. What are my favorites

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.930
? Well, I still have to go with the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.949
W H 1000 X mark three. They're just an

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.480
obscenely awesome pair of headphones. They sound amazing,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.420
the noise canceling, Amazing. They're amazingly comfortable.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.350
They have amazing battery life. There's a lot of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.730
amazing things going on here. If you want to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.899
save 50 bucks and you want even longer battery life

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.230
, these jobbers are a fantastic new option, and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.089
I'm really excited to see this company stepping into this

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:46.149
space. I can't wait to see what they do

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:48.189
with second and third generations the same way Sony has

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.540
. If I were to buy a pair of noise

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.430
canceling headphones and I had$350 I would not buy

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.800
the boat's QC 35 to. And it's not because

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.149
the noise canceling is bad or because they sound bad

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:02.389
. It's just because the Sony's costs the same amount

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.189
of money, have 10 hours more battery life and

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.720
have better sound overall. So if I'm making my

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.459
decision, it goes 123 and there you have it
