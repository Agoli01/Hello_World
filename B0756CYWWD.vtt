00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.279
if you're a frequent traveler or just want to silence

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:04.240
the world around you, it used to be that

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.419
you bought yourself a pair of those headphones. Today

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.949
, though, there are lots of other manufacturers making

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:17.359
some very interesting noise canceling headphones. Hey, all

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.839
Parker from digital trends here and I am here with

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.989
three of the best premium noise canceling headphones on the

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.839
market. We have our reigning champs, the Sony

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.190
W H 1000 X mark three The Bows QC 35

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.329
2 and a newcomer to the league. The Job

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.740
Brah Elite 85 h These are$50 less than both

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.929
of these bad boys, and they boast many of

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.859
the same features and even longer battery life. So

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.829
let's see how they stack up against our two favorite

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.320
noise canceling headphones. The first thing you'll notice about

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.770
this class of headphone is that many of them boast

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.299
very similar looks, and that's because they're supposed to

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.740
appeal to sort of business class personalities. So if

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.270
you look at the Sony option, if you have

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.740
this nice plastic here, cover some nice plush ear

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.379
pads and generally just not too much to look at

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.159
the same is true of the new job elite.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.189
85 h. They have a nice fabric coating on

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.269
the outside, but again very understated. Perhaps the

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:19.629
flashiest of the bunch are these Silver Bows QC 35

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.900
twos. You can also get these in black,

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.719
but you'll notice they always have this shiny Bo's logo

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.530
. And they also always have this switch on the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.340
outside of the year cup, which is something that

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:32.120
both Jabra and Sony do not. D'oh. The

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.099
other thing that all of these headphones have in common

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.920
is that they're designed to be extremely comfortable. If

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.870
you're flying a long distance or on a lengthy commute

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:41.819
, you want your headphones to feel great on your

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.000
head all day. And all three of these headphones

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.939
accomplished that goal. They use these plush leather gear

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.569
pads, and all three have very comfortable headbands so

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.959
that they won't hurt your noggin. After a long

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.040
day on the road, let's talk about what sets

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.349
these headphones apart and let's start with the head bone's

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.709
. You're probably most familiar with Bo's QC 35 to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.260
these headphones have about 20 hours of battery life with

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.510
noise canceling on, and they boast some of the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.379
best noise canceling you're gonna find in any headphones.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.300
Bose has been making headphones for a very long time

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.150
, and they've really dialed in their noise canceling and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.569
their sound profile. So what you get is a

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.460
slightly boosted base, scooped mid range and very crisp

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.889
high end. These aren't the favorites of audio files

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.069
, due to the fact that they have such a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.659
shaped sound profile. But for those of you who

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.780
are looking for sheer entertainment out of your music,

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.060
they absolutely offer that. All right, now let's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.330
talk about our reigning champions, the W H 1000

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.719
X mark three. These are our favorite noise canceling

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.490
headphones on the market for a couple reasons. First

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.340
and foremost, they sound amazing. They have L

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.849
. D A. C and optics technology on board

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.719
for beautifully pristine and crystal clear Bluetooth audio, and

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.280
the noise canceling is easily as good as it offered

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.699
by boats. So you get a flatter, overall

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.300
sound signature, the same noise canceling and longer battery

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.990
life these air good for 30 hours with active noise

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.310
canceling on, and that makes them just an insane

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.439
product from Sony. We still love these guys.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.069
Let's talk about the newcomer, though. Job run

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.710
, one of our favorite headphone brands and really a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.949
brand that has emerged in the last couple years to

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.939
lead the market in a couple places. This is

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.439
their first premium noise canceling headphones, and it's got

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.919
a couple things to set it apart. The first

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.360
thing is that it offers a whopping 36 hours of

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.789
battery life with noise canceling on. That's six hours

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.550
longer than Sony, 16 hours longer than those.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.449
And that means you'll be able to fly around the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.800
world with these babies without having to power them up

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.500
. They also sound quite good. We put them

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:44.199
somewhere between the Sony in the bows they don't offer

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.050
after X or L D A. C. But

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.439
they sure do sound flat and warm and make all

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.099
of your favorite tune sound great. One place that

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.870
we're not quite as big a fans of these headphones

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.650
as we are, the Sony in the boat is

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.569
the noise canceling. They don't white perform as well

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.819
as these two other premium headphones, and that's okay

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.620
because they cost$50 less just$300 that makes them

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.370
one of the best values you'll find in premium noise

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.270
canceling headphones, a place where you don't often talk

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.180
about value. So I spend a lot of time

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.899
with a lot of headphones. What are my favorites

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.930
? Well, I still have to go with the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.949
W H 1000 X mark three. They're just an

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.480
obscenely awesome pair of headphones. They sound amazing,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.420
the noise canceling, Amazing. They're amazingly comfortable.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.350
They have amazing battery life. There's a lot of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.730
amazing things going on here. If you want to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.899
save 50 bucks and you want even longer battery life

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.230
, these jobbers are a fantastic new option, and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.089
I'm really excited to see this company stepping into this

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:46.149
space. I can't wait to see what they do

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:48.189
with second and third generations the same way Sony has

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.540
. If I were to buy a pair of noise

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.430
canceling headphones and I had$350 I would not buy

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.800
the boat's QC 35 to. And it's not because

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.149
the noise canceling is bad or because they sound bad

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:02.389
. It's just because the Sony's costs the same amount

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.189
of money, have 10 hours more battery life and

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.720
have better sound overall. So if I'm making my

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.459
decision, it goes 123 and there you have it
